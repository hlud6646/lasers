Model of a light ray bouncing around an ellipse.

There's a Project Euler problem where a laser is shot through a small aperture into ellispe, which asks you to count the number of reflections the ray takes before exiting through the same aperture.  This is a visualisation of that setup that takes the eccentricity of the ellipse and angle of entry as parameters.
